Project Title: "Global Retail Analytics and Forecasting Platform"
Objective:
Develop a sophisticated analytics platform for a global retail company. The platform will provide a comprehensive view of sales, inventory, customer behavior, and supply chain operations across multiple regions. It will also include predictive analytics for demand forecasting, inventory management, and pricing strategy. The data will be sourced from Snowflake, and the application will feature advanced visualizations, real-time data updates, and user-defined analytics.

Project Structure:
1. Home Page (Dashboard Overview)
Key Metrics: Display high-level KPIs such as total sales, average order value, gross margin, and inventory turnover.
Navigation: Sidebar or top navigation for easy access to different sections of the platform.
Global Map: An interactive map showing sales and inventory levels by region.
2. Sales and Revenue Analysis
Sales Performance by Region: Line charts showing sales trends across different regions, categories, and time periods.
Revenue Breakdown: Bar charts displaying revenue by product category, sales channel (e-commerce, in-store), and customer segment.
Top Products Analysis: Identify top-selling products and analyze factors contributing to their success.
Promotion Analysis: Evaluate the impact of promotions and discounts on sales, including elasticity and cannibalization effects.
3. Inventory Management
Stock Levels and Replenishment: Real-time monitoring of inventory levels across regions, highlighting understocked and overstocked items.
Inventory Aging: Analyze the age of inventory to manage obsolescence and markdowns.
Supply Chain Efficiency: Track lead times, supplier performance, and on-time delivery rates.
Automated Reorder Recommendations: Use predictive algorithms to suggest reorder quantities based on sales forecasts, lead times, and safety stock levels.
4. Customer Insights
Customer Segmentation: Cluster customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and lifetime value.
Churn Prediction: Use machine learning models to predict customer churn and suggest retention strategies.
Customer Journey Mapping: Visualize the customer journey from first interaction to purchase, identifying key touchpoints and conversion rates.
Personalization Engine: Recommend products based on customer preferences, purchase history, and similar customer profiles.
5. Supply Chain Analytics
Supplier Performance Dashboard: Monitor key metrics such as on-time delivery, defect rates, and cost performance.
Logistics and Distribution: Analyze shipping times, costs, and delivery accuracy. Optimize distribution networks and warehouse locations.
Risk Management: Identify potential supply chain risks, such as supplier dependency, geopolitical risks, and transportation bottlenecks.
Sustainability Tracking: Track carbon footprint, waste, and energy consumption across the supply chain.
6. Pricing and Demand Forecasting
Dynamic Pricing Models: Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on demand elasticity, competitor pricing, and market conditions.
Demand Forecasting: Use time-series models to forecast demand for products, considering seasonality, trends, and external factors.
Scenario Planning: Allow users to simulate different scenarios (e.g., economic downturn, supply chain disruption) and assess their impact on pricing and demand.
Price Optimization: Suggest optimal pricing strategies to maximize revenue and margin, considering inventory levels and demand forecasts.
7. User-Defined Analytics
Custom Report Builder: Allow users to create custom reports by selecting specific metrics, time periods, and regions. Include options for downloading reports in PDF or Excel formats.
Ad Hoc Queries: Provide a SQL editor where advanced users can run their own queries against the Snowflake database and visualize the results.
Alerting System: Enable users to set up alerts for specific conditions (e.g., low stock levels, high churn rates) and receive notifications via email or SMS.
